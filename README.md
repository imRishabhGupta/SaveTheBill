# SaveTheBill allows you to store all your consumer bills and set up constant reminders of the due date of pending bills.
All you have to do is sign up in this app, click picture of the bill and fill in a few details. That's it, you are done. You  can store as many bills as you want.

This project uses firebase as it's cloud service where all the bills of users are stored and retrieved from. 
With this project, we aim to build a service that will free users from worrying about the due dates of their bills. Instead, we will do this job for them and keep reminding them about their pending bills.
